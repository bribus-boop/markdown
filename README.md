# 5 things I taught myself about LibreOffice

**Technical Writers use all kinds of tools to create documents.**
One popular word processor is LibreOffice Writer, and open source
word processor for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Over the weekend, I downloaded LibreOffice and experimented with
LibreOffice Writer to create professional documents.
_Here is what I taught myself over a weekend._

## Use styles for everything

LibreOffice is very powerful and lets you create all kinds
of documents.
When creating longer documents, the key is to use styles
for everything.
LibreOffice supports a variety of styles, including
character styles, paragraph styles, and page styles.

If you use styles everywhere, then it's really easy to keep
a longer document looking consistent throughout.

## LibreOffice can import and export Word files

The standard file format in LibreOffice is ODT files,
but LibreOffice can also read and write other files.
I didn't have any problems importing and exporting files from
and to Word format. It even preserved comments in files
that used revisions!

# A brief history of Unix

In the early days at Bell Labs, the Unix team wanted to buy a new
computer to keep working on Unix, but Management said "No."
Brian Kernighan explains:

> Ken Thompson made a deal:
> The Legal team would buy a new computer for the Unix team,
> and the Unix team would update Unix to support the Legal
> team to write Patent applications.
